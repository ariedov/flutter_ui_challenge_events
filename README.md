# flutter_events

A flutter ui challenge inspired by dribbble [https://dribbble.com/shots/3731362-Event-cards-iOS-interaction](https://dribbble.com/shots/3731362-Event-cards-iOS-interaction).

The only challenge implemented here is the synchronized card and title swipe in different directions. With some animation magic it looks quite nice.

All implemented with `flutter` native components, no libraries used.
